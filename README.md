# Personal-Finance-Dashboard
Created an app using Python along with customtkinter and openpyxl to track my finances based on the book "Cashflow Quadrant" by "Rich Dad Poor Dad" fame Robert Kiyosaki

To run the code, follow these steps

1. Pre-requisites 
  You will need Python, Git and few of the dependencies to run the code.

2. git clone https://github.com/basangouda46/Personal-Finance-Dashboard.git

3. change directories into the folder and run Python main.py

4. (only for macOS) if you want an app to run the code, run "python3 setup.py py2app" and you will get the app file in the dist      folder.
